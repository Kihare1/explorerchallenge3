# Explorer Challenge 03
Third challenge of a web programming course!

- I also had to fix a broken code on this one, at least I've learned new commands! Specially some commands to adjust spacement on the website, some stuff like padding/display/justify-content/align-items. 
- And what I think is really cool is the hover command that highlights whenever you mouse over it.
- But generally to fix this broken code I just moved some stuff around, aligned some other texts and that's pretty much it, I also had the Figma project to guide me on my journey.
